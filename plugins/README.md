# Example plugins

Plugins you can install to see what Larvyn plugins do, and copy to start your own.

| Plugin | Kind | What it shows |
|---|---|---|
| [`larvyn.horizon`](larvyn.horizon) | No code, manifest only | ⌘K commands to restart, pause, continue and check Horizon. It adds no stack item, because Larvyn already adds Horizon to the stack when the app uses `laravel/horizon`. |
| [`larvyn.mailpit`](larvyn.mailpit) | Manifest + view | A stack item that runs Mailpit, and a sidebar view of its inbox. The view reads Mailpit's API through `network.fetch`, and Larvyn only fetches from `localhost:8025`, the address its manifest lists. |
| [`larvyn.hello`](larvyn.hello) | View | The smallest view: it reads the open project through `window.larvyn` and shows a notification. Copy it to start your own plugin. |

## Trying them

In Larvyn, open **Settings → Plugins → Install from folder** and pick one of these folders, such as `plugins/larvyn.horizon`. Larvyn shows what the plugin may do, and copies it into its plugins folder only once you allow it.

While you are working on a plugin, you can link its folder instead of copying it. Larvyn then reads your changes when you click Refresh. The plugins folder holds one folder per plugin, named after its id; on macOS it is `~/Library/Application Support/larvyn/plugins`.

```sh
mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/larvyn/plugins
ln -s "$PWD/plugins/larvyn.horizon" ~/Library/Application\ Support/larvyn/plugins/
```

A linked plugin starts off. Turn it on in Settings, which asks you to approve its permissions.

To share a plugin, use the **Export** button (the archive icon) on its row in Settings → Plugins. It saves `<id>-<version>.zip`, which holds one folder named after the plugin, without `.git`, `node_modules` or symlinks. Whoever gets it installs it with **Settings → Plugins → Install .zip**, which unpacks it safely: no paths outside the archive, no links, and the same size limits as a folder. Unzipping it and using **Install from folder** also works.

> **Status:** Larvyn installs these plugins and runs all three kinds of contribution:
> - **commands**, in ⌘K under Plugins;
> - **stack items**, in the sidebar's Stack;
> - **views**, in the sidebar's Plugins group.
>
> The first run of each command or stack item asks you to confirm the exact command line. Views have no network access of their own: they call `network.fetch`, and Larvyn makes the request only to the hosts in `network`. So the Mailpit view needs no CORS setting in Larvyn. Opened directly in a browser for testing, it falls back to `fetch()`, which needs `mailpit --api-cors`.

## The manifest

Every plugin has a `larvyn.json`:

| Field | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `apiVersion` | yes | The plugin API version. It is `1` for now. |
| `id` | yes | `publisher.name`, using lowercase letters, digits and dashes. The plugin's folder must have the same name. |
| `name`, `version` | yes | The display name, and a semantic version such as `1.0.0`. |
| `larvyn` | yes | The Larvyn versions the plugin works with, such as `>=0.1.0` or `>=0.1.0 <0.3.0`. |
| `permissions` | yes | What the plugin may do. Users see this list before they install the plugin. |
| `network` | with `network` | The hosts its views may connect to, such as `api.example.com` or `localhost:8025`. |
| `env` | with `project.env.keys` | The `.env` keys its views may read and change, such as `MAIL_MAILER`. The view never sees any other key. |
| `contributes` | yes | The `commands`, `stack` items and `views` it adds. |
| `requires` | no | The programs it needs on PATH: `program`, an `install` command for `mac`, `linux` and `windows`, and a `url` with install instructions. If a program is missing, Larvyn says so when the plugin is installed and in its row. It offers to run the install command in a visible terminal, after the user confirms the exact command. |
| `description`, `author`, `homepage` | no | Shown in the plugin list. `homepage` must be an http(s) link. |

### Permissions

The permissions marked sensitive are shown in red when a user installs the plugin.

| Permission | Sensitive | Allows |
|---|---|---|
| `project.read` | | Reading the project's name, path and stack |
| `project.env.read` | yes | Reading `.env`, including secrets |
| `terminal.run` | yes | Running commands. Commands and stack items need it. |
| `artisan.run` | yes | Running Artisan commands |
| `stack.control` | | Starting and stopping the project's services |
| `ui.notify` | | Showing notifications |
| `storage` | | Keeping the plugin's own settings and data |
| `network` | yes | Fetching from the hosts listed in `network`, through `network.fetch`. Larvyn makes the request, and refuses any other host. |
| `project.env.keys` | yes | Reading and changing only the `.env` keys listed in `env`. Larvyn backs `.env` up before each change. |

## Views and `window.larvyn`

> To build a view with Vite and TypeScript, start from [`plugin-starter`](../plugin-starter). It includes a typed `window.larvyn` client.

A view is an HTML page from the plugin's folder. Larvyn shows it in a sandboxed iframe, which runs scripts but has no access to Larvyn's page, its storage or its Go side. Its Content-Security-Policy keeps it to its own files:
- Scripts and styles may be inline or files in the plugin.
- Images and fonts may be files in the plugin, or `data:` URLs.
- There is no `fetch`, no forms and no frames.

Larvyn adds `window.larvyn` to every view page. Its only method, `call`, returns a promise:

```js
const project = await window.larvyn.call('project.info')
```

Larvyn checks each call against the plugin's granted permissions, in Go, before doing anything.

| Method | Permission | Params | Returns |
|---|---|---|---|
| `project.info` | `project.read` | — | `{ id, name, path }` of the open project |
| `project.env.read` | `project.env.read` | — | the project's `.env`, as an object |
| `ui.notify` | `ui.notify` | `{ message }` | shows a notification with the plugin's name |
| `storage.get` | `storage` | `{ key }` | the stored value, or `null` |
| `storage.set` | `storage` | `{ key, value }` | stores a JSON value; `null` deletes it. The limit is 1 MB per plugin. |
| `project.env.get` | `project.env.keys` | — | the keys listed in `env`, each as its value or `null` |
| `project.env.set` | `project.env.keys` | `{ values: { KEY: "value" } }` | writes listed keys only, one line each, after backing `.env` up |
| `network.fetch` | `network` | `{ url }` | a GET request made by Larvyn, only to the hosts in `network` (redirects included). Returns `{ status, contentType, body }`. The limit is 2 MB. |
| `terminal.run` | `terminal.run` | `{ id }` | runs one of the plugin's `commands` by its `id`, in a terminal in the project folder. Returns `{ sessionId }`. A view can't run a command line that isn't in `larvyn.json`. |
| `artisan.run` | `artisan.run` | `{ args: ["horizon:pause", ...] }` | runs `php artisan` with these arguments, in a terminal. The first one must be a command name. Returns `{ sessionId }`. |
| `stack.start` / `stack.restart` / `stack.stop` | `stack.control` | `{ key }` | starts, restarts or stops a service in the project's stack (`queue`, `vite`, ...), or one of the plugin's own stack items (`plugin:<id>:<key>`). Another plugin's items are refused. |

The first time a view runs a command line (a command, each distinct Artisan line, or a stack item), Larvyn asks the user to confirm it, the same way ⌘K does. If the user says no, the call fails.

## Looking like Larvyn

Add one line to a view's `<head>`:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/plugin-view/_kit/larvyn.css">
```

Larvyn serves this stylesheet to every view. It sets Larvyn's dark theme on the page and adds `lv-` classes. `--lv-accent` follows the accent colour picked in Settings, and the colour variables (`--lv-bg-2`, `--lv-text-3`, `--lv-green`…) can be used directly.

| Class | For |
|---|---|
| `lv-page`, `lv-header`, `lv-body`, `lv-pad` | a page: a header bar above a scrolling body |
| `lv-btn` (`primary`, `ghost`, `danger`, `sm`, `on`, `spin`) | buttons |
| `lv-input`, `lv-select`, `lv-textarea` | form fields |
| `lv-badge` (`accent`, `green`, `yellow`, `blue`, `red`, `mono`) | small labels |
| `lv-status` (`on`, `warn`, `err`) | a status dot with text |
| `lv-card`, `lv-card-head`, `lv-card-body` | cards |
| `lv-list`, `lv-item` (`active`) | lists of rows |
| `lv-kv` | a `<dl>` of labels and values |
| `lv-code`, `kbd` | code blocks and keys |
| `lv-banner` (`warn`, `ok`, `err`) | a strip under the header |
| `lv-empty`, `lv-ico` | empty states |
| `lv-spinner`, `lv-row`, `lv-stack`, `lv-spacer`, `lv-muted`, `lv-small`, `lv-mono`, `lv-ellipsis` | small helpers |

`larvyn.hello` and `larvyn.mailpit` are built on it.
